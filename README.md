# pt-kana
A simple command-line program that lets you learn hiragana and katakana by querying you about the romaji conversions.

It features a progression system, where new characters are unlocked once you have mastered all currently unlocked ones. The program also keeps track of how many mistakes you make for each character and makes characters you got wrong come up more often.
