# pt-kana
A simple command line program that lets you learn hiragana and kanji by querying you about the romaji conversions.

It features a progression system, where new characters are unlocked once you have mastered all currently unlocked ones. The programm also keeps track of how many mistakes you make for each character and adjusts the frequency how often that character is queried to be higher.
